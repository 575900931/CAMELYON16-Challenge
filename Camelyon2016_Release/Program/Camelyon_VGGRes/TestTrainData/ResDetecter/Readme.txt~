This Method is composed by two parts:
    1. Predict every VGG results by center patch firstly.
    2. Recomputer small patches by taking "4 corners and 1 center" patches to get a weighted average prediction

1. Copy the VGG prediction results into "./VGGcsvDir"
   Copy the trained Res-model into "./Deploys/Camelyon_Res_L0.caffemodel"

2. python ResTool_SlideTesterCrossLv_001_110.py
    The Residual predicting results will be generated into "./ResResults/Tumor_XXX.csv"

3. python ClusterTest_V2.01.py
    Read the results from "./ResResults/Tumor_XXX.csv" to generate the final clustered results into "./RefinedResults/Tumor_XXX.csv"

4. python Evalutation_FROC.py
    Evaluate the final result of location.
